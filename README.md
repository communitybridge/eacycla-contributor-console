# EasyCLA Contributor Console

A stand-alone EasyCLA console for contributors to support the LFX platform.

The contributor console is accessed by a GitHub (or Gerrit) link when a pull request fails to pass the CLA
authorization.

When the user selects the authorization link on GitHub or Gerrit they are directed to the contributor console landing
page.  The user can select either the Individual Contributor or Corporate Contributor options.

If the user selected the Individual Contributor option, a new DocuSign signing request is generated.  For Corporate
Contributors users will need to first select their company from a list.  Both processes are similar.  Additional
workflows are available if the user's company is not configured in the EasyCLA system.
